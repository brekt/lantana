# lantana

Lantana is a browser-based web application that allows users to enter chords note-by-note and to listen to chords alone or played in sequence.

It is written in Angular 1.x, JavaScript, SCSS, and HTML. There are many features I plan on adding, such as a chord picker, draggable chord boxes, tempo control, user accounts and saving songs, and better voice leading.
